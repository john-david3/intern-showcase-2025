Team: John David White, Nutsa Bidzishvili, Mohamad Aldawamneh

## Office Events Planning App
The purpose of this project is to make it ridiculously easy for F5/NGINX employees to organise events. We aim to planning of events such as:
- Where to go for lunch
- Organising places to eat for company dinners
- and more!

## Tech Stack
This project is a full stack web app. Our tech stack consists of the following:
- Frontend: React + Vite with NodeJS
  - React allows us to simplify frontend development by creating TypeScript components that need not be repeated across multiple different pages
  - Languages Include: TypesScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Go
  - We have chosen to use Go/Golang because it is the language that we have been learning as part of our internship, and is effective at creating web apps, especially those using a microservices architecture like we are
- Database: SQLite
  - While SQLite is not the most scalable database, it is free-to-use and will work fine for what we invision for our project
